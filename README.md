# Wrestler-Rivalry-Team-Maker

This program solves the following problem:

There are two types of wrestlers: “Babyfaces” and “Heels”. There may or may not be a rivalry between any pair of wrestlers.  Suppose we have n wrestlers and a list of r pairs of rivalries. Find an efficient algorithm to determine whether two teams of wrestlers ("Babyfaces" and "Heels") can be formed such that each rivalry is only between a Babyface and a Heel.
